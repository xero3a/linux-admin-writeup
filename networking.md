# Networking

This document tracks all networking-related configuration and diagnostics performed on my 
RHEL system, including IP address checks, firewall management, interface configuration, 
and DNS settings.

## Basic Network Inspection

These commands were used to inspect the network status of the system:

- `ip a` – Lists all network interfaces and their assigned IP addresses.
- `nmcli device status` – Shows the status of all available network interfaces.
- `ping -c 4 8.8.8.8` – Tests connectivity to the internet via ICMP.
- `hostname -I` – Prints the system's current IP address(es).
- `ss -tuln` – Displays listening ports and their associated services.

> These tools help ensure connectivity is established and confirm what services (if any) are exposed.


## Configuring Network Interfaces

- Use `nmtui` (Network Manager Text User Interface) for interactive network configuration.
- To view all interfaces and their status:
  ```bash
  nmcli device status
- Bringing an interface up/down
  ~ sudo ip link set <interface> up
  ~ sudo ip link set <interface> down
- Assigning a static IP address (temporarily)
  ~ sudo ip addr add <IP_address>/<prefix_length> dev <interface>
- Deleting a static IP address from interface
  ~ sudo ip addr del <IP_adress>/<prefix_length> dev <interface>
- Permanent network configuration performed by the following actions:
  a. /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
  b. nmcli

## Firewall Configuration (firewalld)

RHEL 9 uses `firewalld` as its default firewall management tool.

# Check firewalld status (start & enable)
```bash
  ~ sudo systemctl status firewalld
  ~ sudo systemctl start firewalld
  ~ sudo systemctl enable firewalld

# View default and active zones
  ~ firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
  ~ firewall-cmd --get-active-zones

# List current rules for a zone
  ~ furewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
  ~ sudo firewall-cmd --zone-public --ass-service=ssh --permanent
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Opening ports
  ~ firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
  ~ firewall-cmd --reload
